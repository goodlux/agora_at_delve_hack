# Agora-AT Integration Project

This project explores the integration of the Agora Protocol with the AT Protocol (ATProto) to create decentralized agent networks that can interact with decentralized social networks.

## Overview

### Agora Protocol
Agora is a cross-platform protocol for efficient communication between LLM-powered agents. It enables diverse agents to communicate with each other cost-effectively while maintaining decentralization and minimal human involvement.

### AT Protocol (ATProto)
The Authenticated Transfer Protocol is a decentralized social networking protocol developed by Bluesky. It provides a framework for building social applications with features like account portability, algorithmic choice, and interoperability.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a bridge between Agora agent networks and the AT Protocol ecosystem
2. Enable AI agents to interact with social content on ATProto networks
3. Create a framework for agents to publish and consume social content
4. Explore decentralized, agent-powered content curation and feed generation
5. Design privacy-preserving mechanisms for agent-user interactions

## Getting Started

This repository is organized into:

- `/docs` - Documentation and design specs
- `/examples` - Example applications and use cases
- `/agora_at` - Python library for integration (to be implemented)

## Potential Applications

- AI agents that can assist users in content discovery and curation
- Automated content moderation assistants
- Personal AI assistants that can interact with your social graph
- Collaborative filtering and recommendation systems
- Decentralized knowledge networks that leverage both human and AI contributions

See the [hackathon projects document](/docs/hackathon_projects.md) for specific project ideas.

## Implementation

This project will use Python as the primary implementation language. The integration will leverage:

- Python client libraries for AT Protocol
- Agora Protocol's Python implementation
- Modern Python practices with type annotations

## License

This project is dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2.0 terms, consistent with both parent projects.
