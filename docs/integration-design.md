# Agora-AT Integration Design

This document outlines the architectural approach for integrating the Agora Protocol with the AT Protocol.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Decentralization First**: Maintain the decentralized nature of both protocols
2. **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Respect user control over identity and data
3. **Protocol Efficiency**: Optimize for minimal computational and network overhead
4. **Privacy by Design**: Build with privacy considerations from the ground up
5. **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems and standards

## Integration Layers

### 1. Identity Layer

The AT Protocol has a robust identity system based on DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and handles, while Agora agents need identifiable endpoints. We propose:

- **Agent DID Creation**: Allow Agora agents to obtain DIDs within the AT Protocol ecosystem
- **Agent Handles**: Optional human-readable identifiers for agents
- **Cross-Protocol Authentication**: Methods for verifying agent identities across both protocols
- **Delegation**: Support for agents acting on behalf of human users (with appropriate permissions)

### 2. Content Interaction Layer

Enable agents to interact with content in the AT Protocol ecosystem:

- **Reading**: Agents can read public content from the ATProto network
- **Writing**: With appropriate permissions, agents can create content on behalf of users
- **Streaming**: Methods for agents to subscribe to real-time content updates
- **Content Processing**: Frameworks for agents to analyze, categorize, and respond to content

### 3. Protocol Negotiation Bridge

Leverage Agora's protocol negotiation capabilities within the ATProto context:

- **Protocol Translation**: Convert between Agora's negotiated protocols and ATProto lexicons
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Implement Agora's efficiency mechanisms for frequent interactions
- **Protocol Sharing**: Allow useful agent protocols to be shared across the network

### 4. Feed and Discovery Integration

Enable Agora agents to participate in content curation and discovery:

- **Agent-Powered Feeds**: Create custom feeds based on agent processing
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Frameworks for agents to collaborate on content recommendations
- **Discovery Mechanisms**: Methods for finding relevant agents and content
- **Reputation Systems**: Optional reputation tracking for agent-provided services

## Technical Components

1. **ATProto Client for Agents**: A specialized client library that allows Agora agents to interact with ATProto
2. **Protocol Translator**: Middleware for converting between Agora's negotiated protocols and ATProto's lexicons
3. **Agent Repository Service**: Repository for registering and discovering agents on the network
4. **Permission Manager**: System for managing user permissions for agent actions
5. **Feed Generator Framework**: Tools for creating agent-powered custom feeds

## Privacy and Security Considerations

- **Transparent Agency**: Clear indicators when content is agent-generated
- **Permission Scoping**: Granular permissions for agent actions
- **Data Minimization**: Access only necessary data for agent functions
- **Audit Trails**: Optional logging of agent actions for user review
- **Revocable Access**: Simple mechanisms for revoking agent permissions

## Next Steps

1. Create proof-of-concept implementations for key integration points
2. Develop specifications for the protocol bridges
3. Build example applications showcasing the integration
4. Establish community guidelines for agent behavior and development
