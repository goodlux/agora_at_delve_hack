# Agora + AT Protocol Hackathon Project Ideas

This document outlines potential hackathon projects that leverage the unique combination of the Agora Protocol and AT Protocol (ATProto).

## Why This Tech Stack?

Before diving into specific projects, let's consider what makes these two protocols particularly powerful when combined:

### Agora Protocol Strengths
- **Efficiency in Agent Communication**: Dramatically reduces costs of LLM-based agent interactions
- **Self-Organizing Protocols**: Agents develop efficient communication without human intervention
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any agent architecture or LLM provider
- **Decentralized By Design**: No central authorities or special nodes required

### AT Protocol Strengths
- **Self-Authenticating Data**: Cryptographically verifiable content
- **Portable Identity**: DIDs and a handle system for stable identity across services
- **Repository-Based Storage**: Structured data repositories for persistent content
- **Federation Architecture**: Balanced approach between centralized and P2P systems
- **Lexicon System**: Schema definition for interoperable data exchange

### The Combination Advantage
When combined, these protocols provide:
1. **Efficient + Persistent**: Agora's efficiency with AT Protocol's persistent storage
2. **Verifiable Agency**: Cryptographically verifiable agent actions
3. **Portable Agent Networks**: Agent systems that can migrate between providers
4. **Social Integration**: Direct connection between agent networks and social systems

## Getting Started

Each of these projects requires similar foundational work:

1. **Agent Identity Setup**: Creating DIDs for agents in the AT Protocol ecosystem
2. **Repository Configuration**: Setting up storage for agent data
3. **Agora Integration**: Implementing efficient agent communication
4. **Specialized Agent Development**: Creating agents with specific capabilities

The repository structure in this hackathon workspace provides starting points for these components.

## Technical Challenges

Some common challenges these projects will face:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Managing agent authentication across protocols
2. **Protocol Bridging**: Creating efficient translations between Agora and AT Protocol
3. **Persistence Model**: Determining what to store in repositories versus ephemeral exchanges
4. **Permission Management**: Handling delegation of user permissions to agents

## Evaluation Criteria

When developing these projects, consider:

1. **Efficiency Gains**: How much does Agora reduce the cost of agent operations?
2. **User Control**: How well does the system preserve user agency and choice?
3. **Interoperability**: How well does it work with existing AT Protocol services?
4. **Privacy Preservation**: How well does it protect user data and preferences?
5. **Scalability**: Can the system scale to many users and agents?
